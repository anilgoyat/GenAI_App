LangChain Prompts:
LangChain provides PromptTemplate and ChatPromptTemplate for building reusable prompts. Prompts help structure the interaction between users and LLMs.

LangChain Chains:
Chains allow combining multiple components such as prompts, models, and output parsers into pipelines. LCEL is the modern way to build chains.

LangChain Agents:
Agents allow models to decide which tools to call dynamically. Agents are useful when tasks require reasoning and tool usage.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
RAG improves LLM accuracy by retrieving relevant context from external documents before generating answers.

Vector Databases:
Vector databases store embeddings and allow similarity search for retrieval. Examples include FAISS, ChromaDB, Pinecone, and Weaviate.
